### Introduction

1. Some **Examples** 
   - Image stuff, such as painting, repainting, processing and so on.
   - Simulation stuff, such as water simulation, physical force simulation, act simulation and so on.
   - Artificial Intelligence, such as Alpha GO, Blockchain and so on.
2. Some basic **Terms** 
   - 数据结构——Data Structure, which usually contains the data elements and relations among them. It can be described as <d, r>.
   - 数据——Data, which is a generalized name for almost every symbol that can be input or processed by the computer. It is the basis of all kinds of software.
   - 数据元素——Data Element, which usually stands for the integrity of combined data items. By the way, it can be either structured or non-structured.
   - 数据对象——Data Object, which is a set for DTs that owe same or similar qualities.
   - 数据项——Data Item, which is the basic component for data element and can not be divided any more in the meanwhile.
   - 数据类型——Data Type, which portrays the range of the data and all the proper operations based on it. 
     - 原始类型 has types such as int, float, double and so on.
     - 结构类型['String' is a structured type of data.]
   - 抽象数据类型——Abstract Data Type(ADT), which is similar to the DT. And technically, it contains a math model and the operations.
     - 聚合类型
       - 固定聚合类型， which means that every component has a variable length.
       - 可变聚合类型,    which means that every component has a fixed length.
     - 原子类型
   - 逻辑结构——Which is the basis of the Algorithm.
     - 集合【无序】
     - 有序
       - 线性结构
         - 顺序表
         - 链表
         - 散列表【哈希】
       - 树型机构
       - 网状结构
   - 存储结构——After knowing about the logical structure, we still need to know how data is kept in the physical component such as memory and disks.
     - 顺序存储结构【映像】
     - 链式存储结构【映像】
3. Some intriguing **Questions**
   - Find the one that contains toxic materials among all 100 bottles of water.
   - Find the Max and Second Max values among all given numbers.
   - How to make a perfect setting for the traffic lights.
   - How to generate a maze or find the way out.
   - Check whether the brackets appearing in the forum are matched or not.
   - Get the value of a mathematical forum.
